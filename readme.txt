This plugin adds functionality to your site based on users copying text.  Logs, highlights and message attachments are all customizable.

== Description ==
All the copy & pasting functionality you could ask for.  Attach a message to text copied from your site, log all copies, show highlights of copies on the pages themselves to everyone, just admins or to no one!

Search logs for entire site or just specific posts/pages.  Also delete logs in the easy to use admin interface.  You can set the highlight color too!

Lots more to come but this plugin already carries a ton of awesome features for you blog.
